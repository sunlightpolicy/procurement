In 2011, that rate was higher, but it went down last year for political reasons. There are a bunch of exceptions and loopholes in Georgian procurement legislation that allow different government actors to avoid the transparent electronic process, but most contracts that are procured without a competitive tender are now also published on the e-platform (you have to register for a free account to see them). Similarly, you have blacklisted and whitelisted companies on the website, you have a dispute resolution broad (we are one of the members) which publishes all its decisions online within 10 working days after a complaint is filed. Complaints against a tender procedure can be filed by anybody on the procurement website by filling out a form, which then freezes the process. ",Yes,"Before 2003 public procurement was the safe haven of corrupt agreements in Georgia. This system was  abandoned and a new platform for public procurement was introduced: www.procurement.gov.ge. Public procurement can be conducted exclusively online. There is zero possibility of corruption as the bidding process is being carried out online on the web-site and any interested party can follow it. The competitiveness is fully guaranteed. In order to maximise transparency, a Dispute Resolution Board was created with civil society being equally represented together with public officials. 
This innovative approach gave the State the possibility to save 202 million GEL of public money that amounts to 14% of the procurement budget. It is planned to further fine-tune the system and find new ways of balancing criteria of price and quality and improve the analytical module of the system.  
The Georgian Government uses an online platform and online bidding for auctions as well: www.eauction.ge. The principles are the same: full transparency, accessibility and equal competition. It is envisaged to make the e-auction system more user-friendly. ",,,,,,,,,TI Georgia

The electronic public procurement system will first be tested in the acquisition of medical devices and of general consumable goods which have been determined as the pilot areas of study. This system will make bidding and evaluation electronically possible, but will also necessitate changes in regulations and hard/soft ware procurement. In the future this system will be applied in other sectors. We will update and upgrade the system in compliance with the feedback from public institutions, active bidders and any legislative amendments that may take place.",,,,,,,,,?
